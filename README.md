## &#128103; About Me

I am located in Pittsburgh, PA on EST Timezone. Since 2006 I have been working remotely as a freelance web engineer/project manager and I specialize in WordPress, WooCommerce and Shopify. I bring 15+ years of experience in the web industry to the table with a solid work ethic to succeed.
<br><br>
I have worked with all types of companies from small businesses to enterprise such as WikiMedia, USA Today and The Hill. In my spare time I like to contribute to WordPress core and contribute coding time to open source projects such as Rocket Chat.
