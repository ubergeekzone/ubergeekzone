## &#128103; About Me

With 15 years of web development experience under my belt, I got my start in computers at an early age, thanks to my trusty Commodore 64 and daisy wheel printer. By the time I was 16, I had already sold my first major website project, showcasing my tech skills and entrepreneurial spirit.
<br><br>
When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I indulge in my love for speed and racing. You'll often find me behind the wheel of my 1984 Lincoln Mark VII, boasting a 302 V8 engine and T5 Manual Transmission, tricked out with various performance upgrades.
<br><br>
My expertise with WordPress earned me recognition as a top developer by Codeable in 2017. I've had the privilege of working with industry giants like WikiMedia and The Hill, as well as contributing to prestigious projects for destinations like The Palm Beaches, North Augusta, and the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
<br><br>
Beyond my professional achievements, I'm deeply committed to promoting equality, diversity, and human rights in all aspects of life and work. I firmly believe in the power of inclusivity and positive change.

## &#128187; What I am Doing These Days

These days, I founded a freelancing venture known as Invoate. Under this business, I offer WordPress website services and digital marketing solutions to clients. I am deeply involved in crafting and developing WordPress websites for clients and providing guidance on digital marketing strategies to bolster their online presence. I am open to full-time/contract roles.
